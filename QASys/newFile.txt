Create a folder
git init
Add the repository created online as a remote using: git remote add origin https://github.com/abhirammv/<reponame>.git
Make the local repo, reflect the online repo: git pull origin master
After which, if you want to make some changes, go ahead
Then, commit every change
Then push it back to the online repository so that it reflects the work you've done: git push origin master
